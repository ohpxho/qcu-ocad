		<p class="font-medium text-xl mt-5">Terms of Use</p>
		<p class="text-slate-500">Last updated: April 23, 2023</p>

		<p class="mt-5">Thank you for using the Quezon City University (QCU) Online Consultation and Document Request (OCAD). This is provided by the University with main operations located at 673 Quirino Highway, San Bartolome, Novaliches, Quezon City.</p>

		<p class="mt-3">By using our online services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read carefully.</p>

		<p class="font-medium text-xl mt-5">Acceptance of Terms</p>

		<p class="mt-5">The online services that QCU provides to you are subject to the following Terms of Use ("Terms"). This is an agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and the University. By visiting, browsing and/or interacting with our online services, you agree to be bound by this Terms.</p>

		<p class="mt-3">QCU reserves the right to update the Terms at any time without notice to you. The most current version of the Terms can be viewed by clicking on the "Terms of Use" hypertext link located at the bottom of our Web pages and online services.</p>

		<p class="mt-3">The University offers various online services wherein additional terms or requirements may apply. As such, these terms will be available to relevant online services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with the University if you use those online services.</p>

		<p class="font-medium text-xl mt-5">Limitation of Use</p>

		<p class="mt-5">The Services are for your academic, non-profit and non-commercial use. QCU grants you conditional access to visit, browse, and interact with the Services as long as you abide with this Terms on your computers running validly licensed copies of software for which the Services were designed.</p>

		<p class="mt-3">The information including images and photos contained within the Services (“Information”) are provided by QCU and may be used for informational purposes only. You may not copy, modify, distribute, transmit, display, reproduce, publish, license, develop derivative/creative works from, transfer, or sell any Information, forms or documentation obtained from the Services.</p>

		<p class="font-medium text-xl mt-5">No Unlawful or Prohibited Use of the Services</p>

		<p class="mt-5">As a condition of your use of the Services, you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms, conditions, and notices. You may not use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any QCU server, or the network(s) connected to any QCU server, or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of any Services. You must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any Services, other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to any QCU server or to any of the Services, through hacking, password mining or any other means. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available through the Services.</p>

		<p class="mt-3">You must not infiltrate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Services or any of its components. Also, you must not use any special hardware or software to download all the files from the Services (either with or without any intention to vandalize, hack or destroy any/all Services).</p>

		<p class="font-medium text-xl mt-5">Use of Services</p>

		<p class="mt-5">The Services may contain e-mail and sms features, dashboard, messaging, document requesting, calendars, and/or online consultation. You agree to use the Online Services only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and, when applicable, related to the particular Online Service.</p>

		<p class="mt-3">The University adheres to the basic principles of human decency, respect and values. We have zero tolerance for messages and comments that curse, trash, degrade, humiliate and intimidate. Such behavior does little to inspire intelligent and educated discussion. Freedom of speech does not mean license to smear reputation and ruin credibility. Nor does it mean the freedom to be irresponsible and to defame. Freedom of speech, rather, is the recognition of the right of anyone to speak his or her mind, and to express a contrary view without being objectionable.</p>
